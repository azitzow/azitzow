## 👋 Hi, I’m Ana Zitzow. I currently reside in Roseville, CA.
In my 14-year journey in the medical field, I honed my skills as a Medical Assistant, taking on diverse roles and projects. The experiences gained, especially in my last position, are moments I am incredibly proud of.

Following my one-year professional experience as a Full Stack Engineer in a startup, I'm eager to further immerse myself in the dynamic world of software engineering. Proficient in languages like TypeScript, JavaScript, Ruby, and Python, and frameworks such as React and Rails, I'm well-equipped to take on new challenges.

I bring a wealth of experience collaborating with teams to deliver highly profitable outcomes. My expertise extends to working with databases like SQLite and PostgreSQL, and I have hands-on experience with tools like Chakra UI, AWS Amplify, React Query, and Playwright.

I am on the lookout for my next role as a software engineer, and I am excited about the prospect of joining a highly collaborative team that values both its vision and its members. Having deadlifted 180% of my body weight, I approach challenges with determination and resilience.

Beyond technical skills, my passion lies in continuous education and personal growth. As a software engineer, I'm eager to contribute to innovative solutions, grow my communication and critical thinking skills, and be a valuable asset to a team that values synergy.

Let's connect and explore how we can create meaningful contributions together!
